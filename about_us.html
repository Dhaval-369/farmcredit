        <h2>About Farmer Credit Score</h2>
        <p>
            Our mission is to empower farmers by providing a fair and transparent credit evaluation system. 
            Traditional credit scores do not consider farming risks like weather conditions, soil health, and crop yield. 
            Our system integrates real-time GIS data, weather forecasts, and market trends to generate an accurate farmer credit score.
        </p>
        <p>
            Financial institutions can now make informed decisions, and farmers can access loans more easily based on 
            their actual potential rather than just financial history. Join us in revolutionizing rural credit access!
